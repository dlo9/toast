## [0.30.0] - 2019-07-11

### Added 
- Added support for specifying arbitrary docker arguments. 

## [0.29.0] - 2019-07-11

### Changed
- `mount_paths` are now allowed to be absolute. This is to support mounting the Docker IPC socket (usually located at `/var/run/docker.sock`) in the container for running Docker commands in tasks.

## [0.28.0] - 2019-06-30

### Changed
- The container used for the `--shell` feature now uses the mount settings and ports from the last executed task, if any.

## [0.27.0] - 2019-06-09

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that would cause Toast to crash if the first task had no environment variables, no input paths, and no command to run.

## [0.26.0] - 2019-06-09

### Fixed
- Fixed the way symlinks in `output_paths` are handled.

## [0.25.0] - 2019-06-09

### Fixed
- Fixed the way symlinks in `input_paths` are handled.
- Fix a bug that prevented the standard error output from being logged if a child process failed.

## [0.24.0] - 2019-06-02

### Changed
- This release contains only internal improvements to the robustness of the code. Upgrading to this new version will invalidate existing cached tasks.

## [0.23.0] - 2019-05-31

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that would cause the `output_files` feature to fail if `/tmp` on the host is on a different mounted filesystem than the destination.

## [0.22.0] - 2019-05-29

### Added
- Added the `--list` option to list all the tasks in the toastfile.
- Added the `description` task field to be shown to the user when `--list` is used.

## [0.21.0] - 2019-05-26

### Added
- Added the `mount_paths` feature.

### Removed
- Removed the `watch` feature in favor of `mount_paths`.

## [0.20.0] - 2019-05-26

### Changed
- Toast now uses the environment, location, and user of the last task when running interactive shells for the `--shell` feature.
- Toast no longer depends on `/bin/sh` existing in the containers it creates.

## [0.19.0] - 2019-05-26

### Fixed
- Fix a bug that would cause failed tasks to be cached.

### Changed
- When using `--shell` with a failing task, the shell environment is now based on the container from when the task failed rather than the last succeeding task. This makes debugging failed tasks easier.

## [0.18.0] - 2019-05-22

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that would cause images to be far larger than necessary.

## [0.17.0] - 2019-05-22

## [0.15.0] - 2019-05-20

### Changed
- Improved the performance of tasks that have no input paths and no command.
- Revamped the filesystem watching feature.
- Toast no longer depends on `chown` and `mkdir` in the container.
- Toast now renders a spinner animation when reading files from the host.
- Toast now requires that caching be disabled for tasks that expose ports or use filesystem watching.

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that would cause the incorrect ports to be exposed in some situations.

## [0.14.0] - 2019-05-19

### Added

## [0.10.0] - 2019-05-16

### Changed
- To match the way Toast runs tasks, the `--shell` feature no longer uses a login shell.

### Added
- Added helpful messages to the spinner animation.
